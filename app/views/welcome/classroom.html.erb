		<p>In 2012, we replaced the leaking and rotting roof on the primary school building. In 2013, the goals of the Classroom Project are to cement floors and walls of 5 primary classrooms, and furnish them with 4-seater desks. Currently, the children sit either on the dirt floor or on broken chairs with another student, making it difficult for them to learn and concentrate.</p>

		<p>Desks are built on the island and transported on the roof by a local bus, called a 'dala-dala', thus contributing significantly to the local economy.</p>

		<p>We are also purchasing cement and hiring the services of a local worker to cement the floors and walls of each of the 5 primary classrooms.</p>

		<h4><strong><center>The cost of a new desk being built and delivered is $110.</center></strong></h4>

		<h4><strong><center>The cost to cement a classroom is $230.</center></strong></h4>
