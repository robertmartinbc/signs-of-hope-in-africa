				<h4>The start of new beginnings</h4>
				<p>In 2003, our founder spent 2 months volunteering in Jambiani, working with Deaf children and teaching English to elders in the village.  It was during this time that Kristi identified key struggles villagers faced in meeting everyday needs.  She quickly realized that some basic projects could provide assistance to meet those needs.</p>

				<p>Signs of Hope in Africa began to take shape. Projects to meet basic needs expanded into projects that enable villagers to develop economic self-sufficiency using locally available resources.</p>

				<p>With successful implementation of each project, the quality of life for villagers in Jambiani slowly improves. With improvement comes growth that opens opportunities for the villagers and the community, and spills over to neighbouring regions.</p>

				<p>Your support is making a positive difference for the lives of many children and their families. We look forward to sharing many more beginnings with you as we continue our work. </p>
				<h4>Our People</h4>
				<p>The board members of Signs of Hope in Africa are all volunteers who passionately invest countless hours to this organization. We also have many dedicated volunteers who donate their time and energy to ensure the success of our fundraisers. The employees we hire from the village to maintain our programs are integral to our progress.</p>

				<p>We are based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Our key focus in Africa is in the village of Jambiani, Zanzibar, Tanzania</p>
